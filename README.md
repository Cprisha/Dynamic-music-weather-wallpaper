# DYNAMIC MUSIC PLAYER SYSTEM
As the intensity of the beats dropped changes, the wallpaper also subtly changes, matching the mood.

---

## IDEA
### Day mode:
- As the user plays music, the sun moves with you.
- A car/hut/minimal object is present.
- When the beat intensity changes, the color of the minimal object also changes.
### Night mode:
- At night, the whole screen goes black.
- The object doesn't change color, instead, there are light pulses emitted with beats.

As the weather changes, external elements like clouds/water droplets/meteor shower/snowflakes also get added to the wallpaper.
The users location helps sync to the weather.
